- [pancakes.py](./pancakes.py) declare Pancake Protocol and all concrete types of pancakes
- [order-bad.py](./order-bad.py) demonstrates non-encapsulated order method, bad for updates
- [order-good.py](./order.good.py) demonstrates encapulated order method, just need to update make_pancake to update whole order method
